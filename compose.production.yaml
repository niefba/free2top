# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
include:
  - compose.db.yaml # with db declared

services:
  server:
    container_name: server_free2top
    build:
      context: restApi
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      target: final
    #environment:
    #  NODE_ENV: dev
    env_file:
      - ./restApi/.env
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    command: npm run start

    # PostgreSQL database used by application. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
    # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
    # database data between container restarts.

      db:
        condition: service_healthy

  client:
    container_name: client_free2top
